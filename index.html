    <h1>On `cal`</h1>
    <p>
      So, there's a lot to say here. This began as an experiment with
      AI-assisted code, and ended with me rewriting it entirely by hand. I
      created this for a friend -- they wanted to have something on their
      website, a Wordpress website, that clients could use to help determine
      what the best NJ Transit fare for them would be. That benefits me too, as
      I commute via NJ Transit and also wondered what the best bang for my buck
      would be. Before I begin,
      <a href="multi.html">here</a> is a link to the finished product. First,
      I'll start by describing the problem space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a round trip commute as a unit, there are four ticket types: Round
      Trip, Weekly Pass, Flex Pass (which will be retired in July of 2024), and
      Monthly Pass. The Round Trip is self-explanatory. It's a ticket that
      grants a rider passage to and from a destination. They do not expire. A
      Weekly Pass is a ticket that given a fixed window from Saturday to Friday,
      a rider has unlimited passes from a set origin and to a set destination.
      The pass is valid only during the specified week. The pricing generally
      works out that it is worth a little less than the fare of four and a half
      Round Trip tickets. The Flex Pass is another value option; for the price
      of eight Round Trips, one can get ten Round Trip Passes, with the
      exception that they must be used within 30 days of purchase. The Monthly
      Pass is a ticket that grants a rider unlimited Round Trip tickets to and
      from a fixed origin and destination. It is worth a little more than
      fourteen Round Trip tickets. Now that we understand the lay of the land, I
      will detail my experience developing this program.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started with a misunderstanding of the problem space, actually. I began
      my development cycle leaving out the Monthly Pass. This would cause some
      issues later. Fresh off working on `ug`, I wanted to see if I could do
      something a little more complex than a shell script with Chat GPT Plus.
      Again, I used gwern's methodology for interacting with GPT with the aim of
      creating a working program. It didn't work out. For building the structure
      and layout of the page though, it did it's job perfectly. I didn't have to
      modify that code at all. I digress. As this is a problem involving finding
      the minimum cost, I tried to guide GPT into writing a solution around
      that. The first hurdle involved getting multiple tickets to render as an
      option, but that was an easy one to clear. Next was setting up the tests.
      Node.js' built-in test runner has only recently graduated from being an
      experimental feature, so it was a bit of a pain to get GPT to recognize
      that this was indeed a valid option, and that I didn't need to use Jest to
      test my application. Eventually, I got that setup and working. Now, I was
      really ready to commit to the implement-test GPT cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on, an issue with identifying consecutive sequences when the month
      border is crossed popped up. Before, I was just storing the day number in
      an array, which corresponded to the days that the user had clicked on. I
      then migrated to using Date objects, as I could then get a better sense of
      what month it was. This is something I could have done with some modular
      arithmetic (and this is something I ended up doing in my own
      implementation later), but for now, this worked. I ran into another issue
      where optimal choices were not being made: Round Trips were suggested when
      a Weekly Pass made the most sense. In my notes, here I remarked on the
      efficacy of using GPT to also write tests. It allowed me to catch stuff
      like this pretty easily. I then realized that I didn't really understand
      how the ticketing worked for Weekly Passes, and was able to amend it. I
      was getting closer, dealing with just a few edge cases. Then I showed it
      to the "stakeholder" and got some feedback. This changed a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was asked to change some things, and was corrected in my understanding.
      I didn't really understand the Flex Pass, I just thought it was unlimited
      in a 30 day window. I was asked to expand the window from the next thirty
      days, to maybe more, to make room for the Monthly Pass that I wasn't aware
      of up until then. And then there were some small details that I haven't
      even factored in yet as I label this project as "finished", like
      accounting for Light Rail access, which comes bundled with a Monthly Pass,
      or that trips to Penn Station might have different rules and prices. After
      this talk with my friend, I put the project down for a while to work on
      some other stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to the project a little while later, and found that I couldn't
      really grok the code, which makes sense -- it's hard enough to push
      something you haven't thought about back into your mind's context, but
      it's even harder to do so when you didn't write the code yourself, because
      the GPT methodology encourages the code to be treated as a black box that
      you validate mostly with tests that GPT writes. So I then implemented the
      Monthly Pass and the corrected Flex Pass, and fixed failing tests as a
      result of these additions. This is where the trouble started to arise. I
      started going in circles trying to get it to work, so I gave up on GPT and
      gave Copilot a try. That wasn't very successful either. Both of those
      services were tough to wrangle into writing code for tests that didn't
      need to be corrected, which kind of sunk that battleship. So I was left at
      a crossroad: try to untangle the mess or rewrite the logic from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to start fresh. Having explored the problem with a near-complete
      implementation once, I now felt that I had a grasp of what the problem was
      and how best to tackle it. I decided to modularize it, that's the gist. I
      observed that when a Monthly Pass is applicable, we can select days from
      the other month. If the logic for the other passes is isolated (previously
      everything was in one function), then it would be possible to just apply
      that to that subset of days to produce an optimal ticket. So by breaking
      it into subproblems, I was able to set myself on the right path. I handled
      cases where a Weekly Pass would be applicable for five and six days
      separately, for example. The ideas was to gather all of the ticketing
      possibilities for a given range of days, then with a pairing of each
      possibility and the corresponding remaining selected days, I could produce
      an optimal fare choice using the pairing that had the minimum cost. This
      was a shift, as before I had the minimum cost at the forefront of my
      solution. From there, it was like running downhill. I was able to come to
      a working solution, plus a few small kinks at the boundaries that I had to
      work out.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some cool utilities that I had to write in this process, for
      example, I re-implemented Set difference, as it is currently only
      available in Safari because of how new the Set API is. I wrote an
      interesting expression that checks if there's a valid window in the
      grouping of extra days mapped to a valid window. The next challenge was
      getting it to work in the context of Wordpress. In the Gutenberg editor,
      you add bits and pieces to a Page in the form of a "block". There's one
      for custom HTML, so the mission became trying to jam all of this into one
      HTML file. It was pretty seamless. I took the code that Typescript
      generated and fit it into a script tag, then only had to make a couple
      modifications: rewriting logic not to use ampersands, moving all of the
      content to a container div instead of directly in the body element, and
      creating another container element that allocated a fixed height and
      width, because the calendar is rendered dynamically, based on what day it
      is. And that was it.
